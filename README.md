## Fnancial Time Series Classification with CNN

This is a project to predict financial time series with CNN. To run, please go through the report first.\\
Then, please follow the below order to run codes:
  a) Run 'Generate CNN Samples.ipynb'. This should create a folder 'cnn samples' under path 'data/', and then create 27 pickle files with specified type of CNN samples (GASF/GADF).
  b) Run 'Training and Validating.ipynb'. This will give training and valiation results of the project. Detailed outlines and introductions can be found either in the report or in the notebook markdowns.
  c) Run 'Strategy Backtest.ipynb'. This shall give a backtest result outlined in the report.
  
  
 Finally, please make all codes visible to each other, since there will be constant calling of functions from all the .py files by the .ipynb files. Other comments are well outlined in each files per se.
